# Eventure: A quest to organise an inclusive event

Organising a research event can often feel like a quest. You have to journey to venues, overcome monstrous challenges, and eventually return to your normal life. And then someone asks you if you've thought about inclusion.

Eventure is a piece of interactive fiction that takes you, the ~event organiser~ eventurer, on a journey to run the best event you can, levelling up your knowledge on the best practice for inclusive events.
